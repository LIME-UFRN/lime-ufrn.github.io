### Integrated Biopotential Acquisition and Intelligent Analysis System

Modular umbrella platform for biomedical signal acquisition and processing, integrating hardware, firmware, and software for biopotentials (EEG, ECG, EMG) and physiological/acoustic signals. The project emphasizes reusable modules, configurable acquisition pipelines, and intelligent analysis for research and monitoring applications.

#### Overview

The project develops an integrated modular platform for acquisition, conditioning, and analysis of biomedical and physiological signals, including EEG, ECG, EMG, and acoustic signals such as rodent vocalizations. The architecture is designed as a reusable and customizable framework that supports different experimental and application needs.

The hardware layer includes low-noise, high-input-impedance analog front ends, high-resolution or high-speed A/D conversion depending on the use case, and embedded processing based on microcontrollers or RTOS-capable systems for acquisition and pre-processing.

The platform also supports flexible connectivity and local storage options, including Wi-Fi, BLE, LoRa, Ethernet, and USB, enabling deployment across laboratory and field scenarios.

At the host software layer, the project includes a control API and libraries (e.g., Python) for parameter configuration, real-time visualization, data recording, digital pre-processing, feature extraction in time and frequency domains, and Machine Learning/TinyML inference for event detection and pattern classification (e.g., arrhythmias in ECG, epileptic seizures in EEG, or rodent vocalization classes).
