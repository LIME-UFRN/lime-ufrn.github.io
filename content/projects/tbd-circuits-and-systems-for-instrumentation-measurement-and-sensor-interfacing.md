#### Overview

This project aims to develop circuits and systems for electronic instrumentation, measurement of physical quantities, and sensor interfacing, emphasizing the integration of analog, digital, and sensing subsystems for embedded applications.

As a continuation of consolidated research in microelectronics and instrumentation, the project addresses signal-conditioning architectures, multichannel A/D converters, reconfigurable circuits, and strategies for data acquisition and processing.

The project combines theoretical analysis with practical implementation through the construction and validation of prototypes, supporting both methodological advances and application-oriented development.
