#### Overview

This project proposes the development and implementation of innovative systems for neonatal neurological monitoring in NICUs, using Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) approaches and consumer electronics to broaden access to inclusive neurological care.

The system integrates low-cost, high-efficiency wearable and non-invasive sensors, including electroencephalography (EEG), intelligent cameras for infant landmark estimation, pulse oximetry, temperature sensing, heart rate, respiratory rate, and environmental variables. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is planned as a future addition.

All devices are based on microcontrollers and support wireless communication protocols such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and LoRaWAN, ensuring flexibility and mobility in NICU environments.

The methodological core is based on Edge Computing and Embedded AI, enabling local processing, efficient data handling, and intelligent decision support in constrained clinical settings.
