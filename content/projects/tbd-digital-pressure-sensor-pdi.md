#### Overview

This project focuses on the development of a digital pressure sensor in partnership with INOVA, designed for integration with a cloud platform for pressure monitoring.

The goal is to transform pressure sensors from isolated devices into active monitoring elements for variables that are critical to automotive operation, composing an integrated and intelligent monitoring system for real-time or on-demand use.

The project emphasizes the use of low-cost pressure sensors for IoT applications. These sensors measure absolute pressure, making them suitable for a wide range of applications, especially pneumatic lines.
